                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <h2>Colorful Crumbs began as a sweet little dream shared between two lifelong friends who bonded over
                    messy aprons, late-night baking experiments, and a love for making people smile. What started in a
                    cozy kitchen filled with laughter and the scent of vanilla slowly grew into something more—a pink,
                    sprinkle-filled cupcake haven where joy comes in bite-sized pieces.</h2>
                <h2>With a shared belief that treats should be as delightful to look at as they are to eat, they poured
                    their hearts into every swirl of frosting and dash of color. Today, Colorful Crumbs is more than
                    just a cupcake shop—it’s a celebration of friendship, warmth, and the magic of small, happy moments.
                    Whether you’re grabbing a box to share or just need a cheerful pick-me-up, you’re always welcome
                    here.</h2>
